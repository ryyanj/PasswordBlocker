# PasswordBlocker
App that blocks password to my pouch locks

common issues:
Sometimes when you git pull on the server a merge conflict happens.

run "git reset --hard origin/master" so that you're changes on the server are overwritten.(I added this to the deployment script so shouldnt need to be done anymore)
